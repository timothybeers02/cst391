## Introduction

JavaScript Web Development CST-391 was a comprehensive course that focused on building modern web applications using JavaScript technologies. The course covered both backend and frontend development, providing hands-on experience with tools and frameworks such as Node.js, Express.js, Angular, and React. Throughout the course, we engaged in a series of activities and milestones that allowed us to apply theoretical knowledge to practical projects.

The primary projects involved developing a Music application and a Christian Library application. The Music application served as an introductory project to familiarize ourselves with setting up development environments, creating RESTful APIs, and building user interfaces. The Christian Library application was a more extensive project that spanned multiple milestones, requiring us to design and implement a full-stack web application with complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

## Executive Summary

This report details the activities and milestones completed during the JavaScript Web Development CST-391 course. The activities centered around developing a Music application, which provided foundational experience in setting up development tools, creating RESTful APIs using Express.js, and building frontend applications using Angular and React. These activities helped solidify our understanding of server-client interactions, routing, state management, and component-based architecture.

The milestones focused on the development of the Christian Library application, a full-stack project that required us to apply the skills learned in the activities to a new domain. Starting with project proposals and API design, we progressed to building a RESTful API connected to a database, developing an Angular frontend to perform CRUD operations, and finally, rewriting the frontend in React to explore differences between the two frameworks.

## Activities

|Activities|Description|
|--|--|
|[Activity 0](./activities/activity0/README.md)|Activity 0 covered setting up tools and running a basic Hello World app locally|
|[Activity 1](./activities/activity1/README.md)|Activity 1 was about setting up a MusicAPI using MVC and routers|
|[Activity 2](./activities/activity2/README.md)|Activity 2 included setup for Angular development tools|
|[Activity 3](./activities/activity3/README.md)|Activity 3 covered setting up and managing data in a frontend Angular application|
|[Activity 4](./activities/activity4/README.md)|Activity 4 removed mock data from our Angular application and replaced it with a live connection to our API|
|[Activity 5](./activities/activity5/README.md)|In Activity 5 we setup a simple React application and used hooks to update state|
|[Activity 6](./activities/activity6/README.md)|Activity 6 included connecting our React app to the REST API and implementing routing and a nav bar|
|[Activity 7](./activities/activity7/README.md)|In Activity 7 we wrapped up the React music app|

## Milestones

|Activities|Description|
|--|--|
|[Milestone 1](./milestones/milestone1/README.md)|Milestone 1 was a project proposal for the web application to be implemented in future milestones |
|[Milestone 2](./milestones/milestone2/README.md)|Milestone 2 refined the project proposal, adding an outline for the REST API we will build|
|[Milestone 3](./milestones/milestone3/README.md)|Milestone 3 included creating the REST API to interface with the database outlined in the previous milestones|
|[Milestone 4](./milestones/milestone4/README.md)|Milestone 4 covered the creation of an Angular application to perform CRUD operations using the API created in the previous milestones|
|[Milestone 5](./milestones/milestone4/README.md)|In Milestone 5, I rewrote the frontend for Christian Library in React|
|[Milestone 6](https://www.loom.com/share/9a3ea51ba39b4396b40ebfa3c65ca10d?sid=a5a41e6a-caf7-468b-a893-f86e2a734b04)|Milestone 6 recapped the previous milestones and shows a presentation of the applications running.|


# Conclusion

The JavaScript Web Development CST-391 course offered a comprehensive exploration of modern web development using JavaScript. Through a combination of activities centered on the Music application and milestones focused on the Christian Library application, we gained practical experience in both backend and frontend development. The course enabled us to set up development environments, create RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js, and build dynamic user interfaces with Angular and React.

By applying the skills learned in activities to the milestones, we successfully designed and implemented a full-stack web application with complete CRUD functionality. Working with both Angular and React allowed us to understand the nuances of each framework, particularly in component-based architecture and state management. Overall, the course provided a solid foundation in web development, equipping us with the technical proficiency to develop complex applications and keep up with the evolving landscape of JavaScript technologies.
