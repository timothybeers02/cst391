## Introduction

- Activity 1 is about setting up the MusicAPI that will be used throughout future activities. The API connects to a SQL database and manages albums, artists, and tracks, offering endpoints to retrieve and update each. It is a REST API utilizing an MVC pattern with a router to define the paths for each endpoint.

## Conclusion

In this activity we learned how to set up a basic REST API using the MVC pattern in typescript. This covered setting up basic SQL queries, calling them from our controller, and exposing them through endpoints defined in our router. We also used Postman to test our endpoints and verify the expected behavior.
